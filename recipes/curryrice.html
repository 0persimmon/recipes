    <h3>A simple cute & quick curry rice!</h3>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>I love quick and easy dinners and curry rice is just that! so quick! so easy! also its sooo cute! You can change the recipe easily to suit your tastes, add meat, no meat, more veggies, lots of potatoes, whatever you want!</p>
    <p>I've listed S&B Curry roux, but you can totally substitute for another brand of your choosing. S&B also has a variety of spice levels so you can customize to your specific taste, definitely doesn't have to be spicy if you don't like spice! Goes well with pickled daikon on the side!</p>
